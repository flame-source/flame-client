# Flame Client

One of the best solutions for playing Minecraft with a licensed account. We provide convenient ways to download mods, texturepacks, shaders and datapacks from such popular resources as Modrinth, Curseforge and Planet Minecraft. We also provide a convenient system of interaction with other users, just like in Minecraft Bedrock! Exchange messages and photos right in the game, and connect to your friends' worlds without opening Realms, paid servers or LAN worlds. In our Launcher there are no monetization methods such as advertising, and other means of monetization. If you want to support the project, please read the "Support" section.
