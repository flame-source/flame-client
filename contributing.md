Below will be an instruction on how to make commits in FlameClient.

Firstly, check if there are any issues, if there are - execute them and then make a pull request and then - countertributors will check your PR and accept/reject it.


If there are no issues, then look at the project code and if you find any vulnerabilities - make a PR explaining what it fixes.


All people who make PRs, we will allocate a line of thanks in a separate file ``thanks.md``.
